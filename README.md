App Concept: Verif - Secure Identity Verification with Aadhaar and Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Build a website for an innovative app called Verif, designed to securely verify a user's identity using their Aadhaar card without revealing the actual card or personal details. The app leverages zero-knowledge proofs and utilizes the fingerprint stored in the Aadhaar system. Verification is done by matching the Aadhaar fingerprint with the user’s live fingerprint captured via their phone's fingerprint scanner.

Key Features:
Zero-Knowledge Verification: Users prove their identity without disclosing sensitive Aadhaar information, ensuring maximum privacy.
Pseudonymous Unique Identifier: Verif acts as an intermediary between the user and service providers, sharing only a unique, pseudonymous identifier with the service. This identifier allows for future traceability if needed, maintaining privacy while ensuring accountability.
Government Collaboration: The app is designed in alignment with India's Aadhaar and UPI ecosystem, highlighting government cooperation for technological advancements.
